# 🌈 Vibe Engineering Tool

A web-based application that helps users understand, analyze, and engineer specific vibes across various contexts - from social media to physical spaces, music playlists to fashion collections.

## 💡 Project Vision

The Vibe Engineering Tool provides a framework for identifying, deconstructing, and recreating specific aesthetic experiences or "vibes." By breaking down vibes into their constituent elements, users can more intentionally craft experiences that evoke particular emotional and sensory responses.

Unlike general mood boards or style guides, this tool provides a structured approach to vibe analysis with quantifiable parameters and practical implementation strategies.

## 🚀 Features

- **Vibe Analysis**: Deconstruct any vibe into its core components
- **Vibe Taxonomy**: Categorize and tag vibes with standardized terminology
- **Vibe Visualization**: Interactive visual representation of vibe elements
- **Vibe Implementation**: Practical guides for implementing vibes across domains
- **Vibe Comparison**: Compare and contrast different vibes to understand subtle distinctions

## 📚 Core Methodology

The Vibe Engineering methodology treats vibes as complex, multifaceted constructs that can be analyzed across several dimensions:

1. **Sensory Elements**: Visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and spatial components
2. **Temporal Dynamics**: Pacing, rhythm, evolution, and duration
3. **Emotional Resonance**: Core affect, mood induction, emotional complexity
4. **Cultural Context**: Historical references, subcultural signifiers, media influences
5. **Functional Intent**: Activity affordances, social dynamics, attention direction

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/saintgull/vibe-engine.git
   cd vibe-engine
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend
   ```
   # Install API dependencies
   cd api
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   ```
   # In the api directory
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your MongoDB URI and JWT secret
   ```

4. Start the development servers
   ```
   # Start API server (from api directory)
   npm run dev

   # Start client server (from client directory)
   npm run dev
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

- `/docs` - Project documentation
- `/api` - Backend Node.js/Express API
- `/client` - Frontend React application
- `/taxonomy` - Vibe categorization system
- `/archive` - Previous project iterations (for reference)

## 🧠 Vibe Taxonomy

The taxonomy provides a structured way to classify and describe vibes using:

- **Primary Dimensions**: Sensory profile, emotional valence, cultural position, functionality
- **Tag Categories**: Aesthetic movements, emotional keywords, contextual settings, cultural references

For details, see [Taxonomy Implementation](docs/taxonomy_implementation.md).
