# User Experience Design

## Core Experience Principles

### 1. Aesthetic Harmony
- The app's visual design should reflect the sophistication of its recommendations
- Color schemes and typography adapt to user preferences over time
- Transitions and animations convey the feeling of aesthetic discovery

### 2. Intuitive Exploration
- Simple, gesture-based interactions for accepting/rejecting recommendations
- Visual cues to indicate why items were recommended
- Clear pathways between different content domains (music → art → fashion)

### 3. Personalized Journey
- Onboarding that feels conversational rather than clinical
- Transparency about how recommendations evolve with user feedback
- Visual representation of comfort zone expansion over time

## User Flow

### Onboarding Experience
1. **Welcome & Concept Introduction**
   - Brief explanation of the aesthetic suggestion concept
   - Set expectations about discovery balance

2. **Preference Collection**
   - Quick selection of initial preferences (genres, artists, colors, styles)
   - Adventure level calibration (how adventurous do you want recommendations?)
   - Spotify account connection (optional)

3. **Initial Recommendation Set**
   - First set of recommendations based on initial preferences
   - Introduction to the interaction model (swipe, save, explore)

### Core Interaction Loop
1. **Recommendation Card**
   - Visual preview (album art, image, product photo)
   - Creator information
   - Brief description
   - Preview functionality (play snippet, enlarge image)

2. **User Actions**
   - Swipe right to like/save
   - Swipe left to dismiss
   - Tap to explore details
   - Hold to see "why this was recommended"

3. **Feedback Collection**
   - Optional micro-feedback on particularly liked/disliked items
   - Periodic reflection prompts ("What aspects of these recommendations resonated?")

### Progressive Exploration
1. **Initial Focus (Music)**
   - Start with familiar domain (music recommendations)
   - Build confidence in recommendation quality

2. **Domain Bridging**
   - Introduce visual art that complements saved music
   - Show connections between domains

3. **Full Ecosystem**
   - Eventually offer recommendations across all domains
   - Allow user to set domain preferences and priorities

## Visual Design Concept

### Color & Typography
- Base palette adapts to user preferences over time
- Typography balances readability with aesthetic personality
- Visual contrast that highlights recommendation content

### Card Design
- Minimalist card layout with focus on visual content
- Subtle depth and shadow to create hierarchy
- Micro-animations that respond to user interaction

### Transitions & Animations
- Fluid transitions between recommendations (60fps smoothness)
- Animation language that conveys discovery and expansion
- Haptic feedback synchronized with visual transitions

## Prototype Screens

```
Initial screens to be designed:

1. Welcome/Introduction
2. Preference Collection (Music)
3. Adventure Level Calibration
4. Music Recommendation Card
5. Saved Items Collection
6. "Why This Was Recommended" Overlay
7. Domain Bridging Introduction
8. Cross-Domain Recommendation
```

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Card transitions must be <100ms to feel responsive
- Image loading should be progressive and optimized
- Audio previews need to start in <500ms

### Accessibility Considerations
- All gestures have button alternatives
- Color choices maintain minimum contrast ratios
- Audio experiences have visual equivalents

### Technical Implementation
- React with Framer Motion for animations
- CSS variables for adaptive theming
- Intersection Observer for optimized loading
